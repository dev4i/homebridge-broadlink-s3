This Homebridge pluggin currently works for all Broadlink LC1 light switches. Make sure to unlock the S3 hub (in the Broadlink app) for the sub devices to automatically be discovered and added to Homebridge. If you have another S3 sub device that doesn't work with this pluggin, I can add support if the device details are provided. Unrecognised device details should be visible in the Homebridge logs.
